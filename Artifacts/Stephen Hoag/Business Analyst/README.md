This document contains further citations and links to the research material that was used in creating the proposal (found near the bottom of the document.)
Beyond research and writing I worked on database design with Andrew. The final product there didn't make it into this particular release but is important to the next phase as we improve the functionality of our side. Additionally, I also helped with filling in the tasks on Gitlab for user stories and generally helped maintain the gitlab according to Sayyed's direction.
