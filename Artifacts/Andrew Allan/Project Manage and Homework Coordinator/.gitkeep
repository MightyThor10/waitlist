As project manager and homework coordinator, a lot of my responsibilities this sprint were related to planning this, and next, sprint.

I worked heavily with Isaac and Annemarie to create user stories, establish a storymap, and then translate that map to a release plan.

During the sprint I worked a bit on the database, and for next sprint I hope to re-create it to scale, with normalized tables containing the attributes we will need for the final product

I also created a template for burndown charts, and used the template to create one for this sprint.
