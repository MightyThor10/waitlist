Project 5:
As project manager and homework coordinator, a lot of my responsibilities this sprint were related to planning this, and next, sprint.

I worked heavily with Isaac and Annemarie to create user stories, establish a storymap, and then translate that map to a release plan.

During the sprint I worked a bit on the database, and for next sprint I hope to re-create it to scale, with normalized tables containing the attributes we will need for the final product

I also created a template for burndown charts, and used the template to create one for this sprint.

Project 7:
For this sprint I focused on customization features for professors designing their waitlist page. I worked with Stephen to add buttons on the CreateWaitlist form to request more information from students regarding major and graduating class. Automatically displaying the chosen information on waitlists, grabbed from students' profiles.
