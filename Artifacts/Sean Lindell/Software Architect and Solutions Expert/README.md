For Project 5 the work I did can be mostly categorized into a few different categories.

The first and most substantial was writing code for the project.
I created the models for the data types, several of the web pages, the functionality for classes and signing up with them.
Annemarie added user signup to the project, and I built in groups to handle content authorization based on different user types (Professors and Students)
Basically, all the core app functionality besides making users and displaying cards for student classes was done by me.
I did not do the project generation or original organization though.

Additionally I crossed off tasks/issues once they were completed in the GitLab

I also was one of the main contributors for the SBIR document alongside Sayyed

I also helped coordinating the project development by maintaining an understanding of the project structure and 
promptly answering question and helping with organization of members as the Solution Expert.

I also filled out my own most crititcal issue as the solution expert.
