# NOTE: My role has been scrum master over the past two sprints (sprint 2 and 3). DevOps Engineer and Technology expert was switched to Isaac Mast after sprint 1.
As the DevOps engineer this sprint, I engaged in writing code for implementing the CI/CD as well as writing 
some basic test cases to test the functionality of some of our most important components. I also engaged in helping team members navigate through the repository. I also set up all the user stories that we came up in our Jamboard and created issues for them in our repo. Also debugged some of the Django code that were wrong. I used some of the documentation that is provided by GitLab itself on https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/ and also watched youtube videos, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=desiTL_EBfE&t=144s to learn the basics of CI/CD and then write the Yaml configuration file. I also used the Django documentations at https://www.djangoproject.com/ to write the necessary test cases. 

For sprint 2 and 3, I have been working on hosting, writing test cases, developing features and making sure that the features we wanted actually gets implemented. For seeing which issues and tasks I addressed, please refer to GitLab and filter issues, tasks, and commits by my Name (Sayyed Hadi Razmjo) or by my usernames (srazmjo) and (MightyThor10). Thank you!
