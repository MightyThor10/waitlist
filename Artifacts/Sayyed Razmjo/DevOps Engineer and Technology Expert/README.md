As the DevOps engineer this sprint, I engaged in writing code for implementing the CI/CD as well as writing 
some basic test cases to test the functionality of some of our most important components. I also engaged in helping team members navigate through the repository. I also set up all the user stories that we came up in our Jamboard and created issues for them in our repo. Also debugged some of the Django code that were wrong. I used some of the documentation that is provided by GitLab itself on https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/ and also watched youtube videos, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=desiTL_EBfE&t=144s to learn the basics of CI/CD and then write the Yaml configuration file. I also used the Django documentations at https://www.djangoproject.com/ to write the necessary test cases.
