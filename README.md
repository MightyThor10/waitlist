Waitlist is tool meant to remedy the hassle that students
and professors are met with when course registration rolls
around. It provides a streamlined interface for professors
to list their classes and enable the waitlist when desired.
Students have a similarly streamlined interface where all
their waitlist needs are met.

First, make sure you are working with an up-to-date
version of the repository. Then, navigate to the base
directory of the waitlist repository:


cd [PATH_TO_REPO]/waitlist/Code

Then create a new virtual environment, activate it, and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to get required dependencies
(Information on creating and activating python virtual environments: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Then run the following command to start the server:

# To start the django server
python3 manage.py runserver


The command prompt should indicate where the development
server was started, which should match this address:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Open the address in a browser to view Waitlist.
