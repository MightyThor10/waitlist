# Waitlist Management Platform

##### Welcome to our MVP for a waitlist management platform designed for college students and professors to seamlessly control their course waitlists in a one-stop-shop platform. 

This is the code repository for Waitlist, developed by:
1. Andrew Allan
2. Ryan Gainor
3. Sean Lindell
4. Isaac Mast
5. Sayyed Hadi Razmjo
6. Annemarie Zheng
7. Stephen Hoag

Waitlist is tool meant to remedy the hassle that students
and professors are met with when course registration rolls
around. It provides a streamlined interface for professors
to list their classes and enable the waitlist when desired.
Students have a similarly streamlined interface where all
their waitlist needs are met.

## Instructions on how to download and start using this platform locally

First, make sure you are working with an up-to-date
version of the repository. For running the project locally, please clone the project. Then, navigate to the base
directory of the waitlist repository:


```cd [PATH_TO_REPO]/waitlist/Code```

Then create a new virtual environment, activate it, and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to get required dependencies
(Information on creating and activating python virtual environments: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Upon successfully installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the server:

```python3 manage.py runserver```


The command prompt should indicate where the development
server was started, which should match this address:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Open the address in a browser to view the Waitlist platform.
